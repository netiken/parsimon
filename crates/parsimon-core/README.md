# `parsimon-core`

This crate defines `Parsimon`'s core types as well as the machinery for
decomposing simulations and aggregating their results.

The main entry point is the `run()` function defined in `src/run.rs`, as well
as the `Network`, `SimNetwork`, and `DelayNetwork` types. Consult the
documentation with `cargo doc` for more details.
